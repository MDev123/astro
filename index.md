## Welcome to AstroBot's Spaceship!

Astro is a bot using Roblox API to transit between JSON and Lua.

# Breaking Down

This is an important step to do on Roblox Studio. Decoding is the only way for Roblox Studio to read the API.

Not decoding the JSON message into Lua will cause problems. First, you will get no response in the output, only an error.

# How It Works

Like on https://avatar.roblox.com, you see {"message": "OK"} and thats like the template we use. That's a signal to us that it sent some info to the Roblox
Servers.
